            <p>JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. It is a small and lightweight
                language. Inside a host environment (for example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the
                objects of its environment to provide programmatic control over them.</p>
            <br>
            <p>JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array, Date, and Math, and a core set of
                language elements such as operators, control structures, and statements. Core JavaScript can be extended
                for a variety of purposes by supplementing it with additional objects; for example:</p>
            <ul>
                <li> Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects to control a browser and its
                    Document Object Model (DOM). For example, client-side extensions allow an application to place
                    elements on an HTML form and respond to user events such as mouse clicks, form input, and page
                    navigation.</li>
                <li>Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects relevant to running JavaScript
                    on a server. For example, server-side extensions allow an application to communicate with a
                    database, provide continuity of information from one invocation to another of the application, or
                    perform file manipulations on a server.</li>

            <header> What is JavaScript, really?</header>
            <p>Not to be mistaken with the language, Java, JavaScript is a programming language that adds interactivity
                to your website (for example games, responses when buttons are pressed or data is entered in forms,
                dynamic styling, and animation). This article helps you get started with this exciting language and
                gives you an idea of what is possible.</p>

            <header>What you should already know </header>
            <p>This guide assumes you have the following basic background:</p>
            <br>
            <ul>
                <li>A general understanding of the Internet and the World Wide Web (WWW).</li>
                <li>Good working knowledge of HyperText Markup Language (HTML).</li>
                <li>Some programming experience. If you are new to programming, try one of the tutorials linked on the
                    main page about JavaScript.</li>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="Hello_World!">
            <header>Hello World!</header>
            <p>To get started with writing JavaScript, open the Scratchpad and write your first "Hello world" JavaScript
                code: </p>

            <code>function greetMe(yourName) { alert("Hello " + yourName); }
                greetMe("World"); </code>

            <p>Select the code in the pad and hit Ctrl+R to watch it unfold in your browser!</p>

            <section class="main-section" id="Variables">
                <header>Variables</header>
                <p>You use variables as symbolic names for values in your application. The names of variables, called
                    identifiers, conform to certain rules.</p>

                <p> A JavaScript identifier must start with a letter, underscore (_), or dollar sign ($); subsequent
                    characters can also be digits (0-9). Because JavaScript is case sensitive, letters include the
                    characters "A" through "Z" (uppercase) and the characters "a" through "z" (lowercase).</p>

                <p>You can use ISO 8859-1 or Unicode letters such as å and ü in identifiers. You can also use the
                    Unicode escape sequences as characters in identifiers. Some examples of legal names are Number_hits,
                    temp99, and _name.</p>
            </section>
            <section class="main-section" id="Declaring_Variables">
                <header>Declaring Variables</header>
                <p>You can declare a variable in three ways:
                    With the keyword var. For example,
                </p>
                <code> var x = 42 </code>
                <p>
                    This syntax can be used to declare both local and global variables.</p>

                <p> By simply assigning it a value. For example: </p>
                <code> x = 42 </code>
                <p>This always declares a global variable. It generates a strict JavaScript warning. You shouldn't use
                    this variant.</p>

                <p>With the keyword let. For example,</p>
                <code> let y = 13 </code>
                <p>
                    This syntax can be used to declare a block scope local variable. See Variable scope below. </p>
            </section>
            <section class="main-section" id="Variable_Scope">
                <header>Variable Scope</header>
                <p>When you declare a variable outside of any function, it is called a global variable, because it is
                    available to any other code in the current document. When you declare a variable within a function,
                    it is called a local variable, because it is available only within that function.

                    JavaScript before ECMAScript 2015 does not have block statement scope; rather, a variable declared
                    within a block is local to the function (or global scope) that the block resides within. For example
                    the following code will log 5, because the scope of x is the function (or global context) within
                    which x is declared, not the block, which in this case is an if statement.</p>
                <code>if (true) { var x = 5; } console.log(x); // 5</code>
                <p>This behavior changes, when using the let declaration introduced in ECMAScript 2015.</p>
                <code>if (true) { let y = 5; } console.log(y); // ReferenceError: y is not
                    defined</code>
